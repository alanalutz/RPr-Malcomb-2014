# Planned revisions to reproduction of Malcomb et al. 2014

Author: Alana Lutz

## Analysis

1) Modify the final vulnerability raster calculation from an additive aggregation to a geometric aggregation.
Additive aggregations assume that there is no interaction between indicators, which is often not the case with social vulnerability variables.
Additive aggregations may also increase compensability, in which a low value in one indicator can mask a high value in another.
Geometric aggregation can reduce issues with interaction and compensability.
2) Modify code to visualize maps with tmap instead of ggplot2.
This change will improve the aesthetics and clarity of the maps for better communication of results.
